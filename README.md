      I've researched python
      I've looked into the different lamguages which specify the type of job you would take like c# is more gaming and python is more bank and solving problem based.
      
    - Note any particular areas that piqued your interest.
      I'm interested in designing AI's tailored to improving everyday life duties which we humans do but can deligate so we have more family time.
      
2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - Reflect on how these industries/roles align with your skills, interests, and values.
      They align with my interest because I am more of a numbers and stats guy compared to making things look nice even though it was much more simple to learn css compared to javascript and python which I find difficult to understand as simple compared to css.
      
    - Identify any gaps or areas for further exploration.
      I still need to put more time to learning javascript.

      R-Atleast watch a 30min video related to my career goal for motivational purposes.
